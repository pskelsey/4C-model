# Crop Connectivity under Climate Change

## Basic overview
A desktop app for performing climate change risk assessments in real crop locations in Great Britain. 
* Build your own risk model in a few easy clicks.
* Choose a crop species distribution to apply it in, or generate your own.
* Select a climate variable, a future time-period and month, and pick your greenhouse gas emissions scenario.
* Define the level of connectivity among crop locations, if desired.
* Hit the run button, visualise your results, and save them to create your own graphics.

## Motivation
I built this app so that absolutely anybody can perform a state-of-the-art climate change risk assessment. Maybe you are a scientist with absolutely no modelling experience, but you have some experimental data and want to realise the future implications of your results. Or maybe you have no scientific expertise whatsoever, but have questions regarding land use in GB under climate change. The app brings together real crop / land-use data from IACS, JACS, and CROME, and UKCP09 spatially coherent probabilistic climate change data, all under one roof. Selecting what you want is just a matter of hitting a few switches and twiddling a few knobs. I've used this framework to produce several peer-reviewed journal articles, and you can too.
