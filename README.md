# Crop Connectivity under Climate Change

### Basic overview
***
A desktop app for performing climate change risk assessments in real crop locations in Great Britain. 
* Build your own risk model in a few easy clicks.
* Choose a crop species distribution, or generate your own.
* Select a future time-period and month, and pick your greenhouse gas emissions scenario.
* Define the level of connectivity among crop locations, if desired.
* Hit the run button, visualise your results, and save them to create your own graphics.

### Motivation
___
I built this app so that absolutely anybody can perform a state-of-the-art climate change risk assessment. It uses real crop / land-use data from IACS, JACS, and CROME, and UKCP09 spatially coherent probabilistic climate change data. Selecting what you want is just a matter of hitting a few switches and twiddling a few knobs. I have used this framework to produce several peer-reviewed journal articles, and you can too.
